    "Our solution uses a zero-trust architecture to safeguard sensitive VA data. By segmenting the network and enforcing strong identity and access controls, we reduce lateral movement and minimize breach impact. The design aligns with NIST SP 800-207 and supports future expansion.",
    "We will stand up 24/7 monitoring using a combination of SIEM tools and a managed security operations center. Coupled with targeted training for VA staff, this ensures rapid detection and response to threats while building institutional knowledge."
